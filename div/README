mimetypes.

mime.types is from apache,
mime.csv from some gist I cannot find just now.

mime.cvs.1 https://gist.github.com/jimschubert/94894c938d8f9f64c6863b28c70a22cc/raw/5b17acd7926bc40909563d14c32c201d7808eaa3/mime.csv

convert.pl: convert arg1 into mimetypes.h
(old, would need to be changed)

a format, close to mime.types, is needed:

mimetype \s  ext ext2 ext3 ..

comments are ignored, and all those vnd.xxx mimetypes.
